## 🧠 Why This Matters

This project reflects my **commitment to mastering GenAI foundations** with both technical depth and business context. I didn’t just complete a course — I turned it into a structured, reusable knowledge asset.

> “If you can teach it, you own it.”

This repo proves I can do both — and build from here.
