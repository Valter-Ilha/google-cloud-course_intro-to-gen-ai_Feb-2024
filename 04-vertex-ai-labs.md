# 04 - Prompt Design in Vertex AI
# 🧪 Vertex AI Labs — Hands-On Exploration with Google’s GenAI Stack

These four labs were a pivotal moment in this learning path — not just for practicing the tools, but for engaging with Generative AI at the implementation level. They combined experimentation, SDK/API awareness, and practical strategy, enabling me to test real-world scenarios as a future consultant and AI solution architect.

## 🔧 Lab 1 — Prompt Design in Vertex AI

**🧠 Objectives:**

- Learn core principles of prompt engineering using Google GenAI SDK.
- Apply techniques like task definition, conciseness, and specificity.
- Use prompts for ideation, Q&A, classification, summarization, and extraction.

**🔍 My Perspective:**

This lab sharpened my ability to shape GenAI outcomes through precise prompt control. I approached this like tuning a musical instrument — small variations in tone, focus, and structure significantly changed the response behavior. It confirmed that prompt engineering is both a craft and a strategy tool.

## 🧪 Lab 2 — Getting Started with Vertex AI Studio

**🧠 Objectives:**

- Create full applications from prompt flows.
- Engineer, manage, and optimize generative prompts.
- Use multimodal inputs (text, images).

**🧩 Scenario:**

Help an insurance company prototype a GenAI-based risk assistant.

**🔍 My Perspective:**

This lab was a leap from abstract learning to practical prototyping. It showed how quickly GenAI models like Gemini can be integrated into business flows. The Studio’s interface makes it accessible even for non-coders — a powerful insight for cross-functional teams. As a strategist, I saw potential here for MVPs, internal copilots, and CX enhancers.

## 🧪 Lab 3 — Getting Started with the GenAI SDK

**🧠 Objectives:**

- Use the GenAI SDK for Python (Gemini).
- Connect to GenAI services and send multimodal prompts.
- Control model behavior with system instructions and filters.
- Work with advanced tools (function calling, embeddings, multi-turn).

**🔍 My Perspective:**

This lab shifted my attention to engineering-grade execution. I explored how to fine-tune prompts programmatically and shape GenAI responses in code. This is where consultants and developers converge — aligning business intent with API-driven precision. It also opened the door to custom pipeline design and agent workflows.

## 🏁 Challenge Lab — Prompt Design in Vertex AI

**🎯 Goal:**

Complete a timed, self-guided task without instructions — applying all learned techniques in a real-world simulation.

**🧠 Topics Tested:**

- Prompt structure and parameter use in Vertex AI Studio.
- Applying Gemini to create marketing taglines and product descriptions.
- Exporting and running Vertex-generated Python code.
- Using Jupyter Notebooks to test and modify prompt flows.

**🔍 My Reflection:**

This was more than a test — it was a mirror. Every mistake became a learning opportunity. I appreciated the emphasis on autonomy and debugging under pressure — skills that resonate with both consultants and engineers in fast-paced environments. Completing it with full success brought a real sense of applied mastery.

### 💡 Strategic Takeaway

These labs didn’t just teach how to use tools — they revealed how Generative AI can be a consulting asset, an innovation trigger, and a transformation enabler. They connected my previous experience in operational excellence and data science with a new layer of power: intelligent augmentation at scale.
